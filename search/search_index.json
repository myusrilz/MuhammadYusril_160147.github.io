However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional CSS \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.css \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Spin up the live preview server and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you should see them almost instantly after saving. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 javascripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.js \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you can update to the latest version more easily. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you then reference using the custom_dir key: theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in mkdocs.yml . It will not work when cloning from git . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory. The directory layout of the theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 .icons/ # Bundled icon sets \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # Third-party integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 analytics.html # - Google Analytics \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 disqus.html # - Disqus \u2502 \u251c\u2500 languages/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 logo.html # Logo in header and sidebar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 palette.html # Color palette \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-date.html # Last updated date \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-link.html # Link to source file \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override a partial, we can replace it with a file of the same name and location in the overrides directory. For example, to replace the original footer.html , create a footer.html file in the overrides/partials directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 footer.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding blocks recommended \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend) template blocks , which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. To override a block, create a main.html file inside the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 main.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following line to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} < title > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ title > {% endblock %} Material for MkDocs provides the following template blocks: Block name Purpose analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the Disqus integration extrahead Empty block to add custom meta tags fonts Wraps the font definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) outdated Wraps the version warning scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) source Wraps the linked source files site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation . Additional variables \u00b6 Besides template blocks, Material for MkDocs provides extra variables for parts that cannot be overridden with template blocks (due to technical limitations of the template engine). If you want to add further information after the Made with Material for MkDocs hint in the footer, add the following line to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% set extracopyright %} <!-- Add your additional information here --> {% endset %} Material for MkDocs provides the following additional variables: Block name Purpose extracopyright Adds custom copyright information Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is built on top of TypeScript , RxJS and SASS , and uses a lean, custom build process to put everything together. 1 If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 14 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin pip install mkdocs-redirects npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the watcher with: npm start Then, in a second session, start the MkDocs live preview server with: mkdocs serve Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overwritten when the theme is built. Building the theme \u00b6 When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final files are located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in the original mkdocs.yml . Now you can run mkdocs build and you should see your documentation with your changes to the original theme. Prior to version 7.0, the build was based on Webpack. This led to broken builds due to frequent incompatibilities with loaders and plugins, so we decided to swap Webpack for a leaner custom solution which is now based on RxJS as the application itself. This enabled us to remove more than 500 dependencies (~30% less). \u21a9","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for MkDocs is a great starting point for making it look beautiful.

The redirects plugin provides the ability to define redirect mappings via mkdocs.yml , which is considered to be a much better solution to achieve the same result. It can be installed with pip : pip install mkdocs-redirects Redirect mappings can then be added to mkdocs.yml : plugins : - redirects : redirect_maps : path/to/old/file.md : path/to/new/file.md Source link \u00b6 Deprecated: 5.5 \u00b7 Removed: 6.0 The source and path keys, which could be added via Metadata , showed a source icon at the top right corner of a document, linking a document to a single source file: --- path: tree/master/docs source: deprecations.md --- # Document title ... Only a single source file could be linked, which is useless if a document refers to multiple files (or multiple sections within a single file). A more flexible approach is to use the new icon integration : [:octicons-file-code-24: Source](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/blob/master/docs/deprecations.md) This will render as Source , which can be included at arbitrary positions in any document. Hero \u00b6 Deprecated: 5.5 \u00b7 Removed: 6.0 The hero key, which could be added via Metadata , allowed to render a simple, text-only and page-local teaser text as part of a document. It could be set from front matter with: --- hero: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet --- # Document title ...

No problem, Material for MkDocs already has tons of features available, so chances are that most of your requirements are already satisfied. See the list of exclusive features to learn which features are currently only available to sponsors. How to become a sponsor \u00b6 You can become an eligible sponsor with your individual or organization's GitHub account. Visit squidfunk's sponsor profile , pick any tier from $10/month 2 , and complete the checkout. Then, after a few hours, @squidfunk will add you as a collaborator to the super-secret private GitHub repositority containing the Insiders edition, which contains all brand new and exclusive features . Important : If you're sponsoring @squidfunk through a GitHub organization, please send a short email to sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of your organization and the account that should be added as a collaborator. 3 You can cancel your sponsorship anytime. 4 Join our awesome sponsors If you sponsor publicly, you're automatically added here with a link to your profile and avatar to show your support for Material for MkDocs. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your sponsorship private, you'll be a silent +1. You can select visibility during checkout and change it afterwards. Exclusive features \u00b6 The following features are currently exclusively available to sponsors: Linking content tabs Boosting pages in search Tags (with search integration) Stay on page when switching versions Version warning Custom admonition icons Code block annotations Anchor tracking Section index pages Sticky navigation tabs Mermaid.js integration Search suggestions Search highlighting Search sharing Remove generator notice New features are added to this list every few weeks, so be sure to come back from time to time to learn about what's new, or follow @squidfunk on Twitter to stay updated. Funding \u00b6 Goals \u00b6 Following is a list of funding goals. When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released to the public for general availability. $ 2,500 \u2013 Biquinho Vermelho \u00b6 Search suggestions Search highlighting Search sharing $ 3,000 \u2013 Caribbean Red \u00b6 Sticky navigation tabs Section index pages Remove generator notice $ 4,000 \u2013 Ghost Pepper \u00b6 Anchor tracking Code block annotations Version warning $ 5,000 \u2013 Aji Panca \u00b6 Mermaid.js integration Stay on page when switching versions Tags (with search integration) $ 6,000 \u2013 Trinidad Scorpion \u00b6 Boosting pages in search Improved search result summaries Stay on page when switching languages $ 7,000 \u2013 Royal Gold \u00b6 Table of contents auto-collapse Table of contents follows active anchor Native lightbox integration $ 8,000 \u2013 Scotch Bonnet \u00b6 Custom admonition icons Linking content tabs List of last searches Future \u00b6 Material for MkDocs Live Edit New layouts and styles Code block palette toggle Goals completed \u00b6 $ 2,000 \u2013 Black Pearl \u00b6 Latest release tag Color palette toggle Back-to-top button $ 1,500 \u2013 Bhut Jolokia \u00b6 Admonition inline blocks Site language selection Versioning $ 1,000 \u2013 Prairie Fire \u00b6 Navigation sections Navigation expansion Hiding the sidebars Table of contents in navigation Header hides on scroll $ 500 \u2013 Madame Jeanette \u00b6 Improved search result grouping Improved search result relevance and scoring Missing query terms in search results Frequently asked questions \u00b6 Compatibility \u00b6 We're running an open source project and want to make sure that users can build the documentation without having access to Insiders. Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. All new features are implemented behind feature flags; all configuration changes are backward-compatible. This means that your users will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions). Thus, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users. Payment \u00b6 We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options? Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle . If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). One-time payments are not eligible for Insiders. Terms \u00b6 We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source. Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes, some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 Note that $10/month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. If you sponsor with a lower amount, it's still very much appreciated, but you won't be granted access to Insiders. Custom amounts of $10+ are also eligible. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable. \u21a9","title":"Insiders"},{"location":"insiders/#insiders","text":"Material for MkDocs follows the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders .

If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). One-time payments are not eligible for Insiders.","title":"Payment"},{"location":"insiders/#terms","text":"We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source. Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes, some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 Note that $10/month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. If you sponsor with a lower amount, it's still very much appreciated, but you won't be granted access to Insiders. Custom amounts of $10+ are also eligible. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable.

Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown (including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier. Example : !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks . Example : !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded content \u00b6 Admonitions can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks. While the parser from the standard Markdown library doesn't account for nested blocks, the SuperFences extension adds the ability to nest arbitrary content inside admonitions. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. ``` python def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Collapsible blocks \u00b6 The Details extension adds support for rendering collapsible admonition blocks. This is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature. A details block follows the syntax and semantics of admonition blocks, but must start with ??? . Example : ??? note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Adding a + after ??? will render the block as open on page load: Example : ???+ note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Inline blocks \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Experimental Admonitions and Details can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e. sidebars), placing them to the right using the inline + end modifiers, or to the left using only the inline modifier. Important : Admonitions that use the inline modifiers must be declared prior to the content block you want to place them beside. If there's insufficient space to render the admonition next to the block, the admonition will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. inline end Example / Result : Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. !!! info inline end Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Use inline end to align to the right (left for rtl languages). inline Example / Result : Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.

Changing the icons \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Insiders only Each of the supported admonition types has a distinct icon, which can be changed to any icon bundled with the theme.

Material for MkDocs provides different ways to set up syntax highlighting for code blocks, either during build time using Pygments or during runtime using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Configuration \u00b6 Highlight \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension \u00b7 Supersedes: CodeHilite The Highlight extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , integrates with Material for MkDocs and provides several options for configuring syntax highlighting of code blocks: use_pygments Default: true \u2013 This option allows to control whether highlighting should be carried out during build time by Pygments or runtime with a JavaScript highlighter. Remember to add the necessary additional stylesheets and JavaScript if you want to use the latter: Pygments markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight - pymdownx.superfences JavaScript markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : false Syntax highlighting with Highlight.js Highlight.js can be integrated by creating an additional JavaScript file initializing the highlighter and including the respective stylesheet and JavaScript from a CDN serving Highlight.js in mkdocs.yml : docs/javascripts/config.js document $ . subscribe (() => { hljs . highlightAll () }) mkdocs.yml extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/highlight.min.js - javascripts/config.js extra_css : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/styles/default.min.css Note that Highlight.js has no affiliation with the Highlight extension. linenums Default: false \u2013 This option will add line numbers to all code blocks. If you wish to add line numbers to some , but not all code blocks, consult the section on adding line numbers later in this document, which also contains some tips on working with line numbers: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums : true linenums_style Default: table \u2013 The Highlight extension provides three ways to add line numbers, all of which are supported by Material for MkDocs. While table wraps a code block in a table, inline and pymdownx-inline render line numbers as part of the line itself: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums_style : pymdownx-inline Note that inline will put line numbers next to the actual code, which means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of table or pymdownx-inline is recommended. Material for MkDocs doesn't provide official support for the other options of this extension, so they may be supported but might yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. InlineHilite \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The InlineHilite extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions also integrates with Material for MkDocs and adds support for syntax highlighting of inline code blocks . It's built on top of the Highlight extension and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.inlinehilite See the section on inline code blocks for usage information. Keys \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Keys extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for inserting keyboard keys , e.g. Ctrl + Alt + Del , and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.keys SuperFences \u00b6 The SuperFences extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for the nesting of code blocks inside other blocks , and is therefore strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences Snippets \u00b6 The Snippets extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows to insert content from other files or other, regular content, and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.snippets Usage \u00b6 This section discusses how to use different syntax highlighting features with Pygments \u2013 the default highlighter \u2013 so they don't apply when using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Specifying the language \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add code highlighting to those blocks, add the language short name directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the short name for a given language. Example : ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result : import tensorflow as tf Adding annotations \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only Annotations offer a comfortable and friendly way to attach explanations to arbitrary sections of code blocks by adding simple markers within block/inline comments that refer to items of a list following the code block, i.e. (1) , (2) , etc. Material for MkDocs detaches the list from the flow of the document, injects the content of each list item into a tooltip, and links each list marker to the corresponding tooltip. In order to opt-in to annotation support, a slightly different syntax is required \u2013 just add the respective language short code and the .annotate class, after the three backticks. Note that annotations can be placed anywhere in a code block where a comment for the language can be placed, which for JavaScript is // (1) and /* (2) */ , for Yaml # (3) , etc. Example : ``` { .js .annotate } document$.subscribe(function() { // (1) var tables = document.querySelectorAll(/* (2) */ \"article table\") tables.forEach(function(table) { new Tablesort(table) }) }) ``` 1. ... 2. ... Result : document $ . subscribe ( function () { // (1) var tables = document . querySelectorAll ( /* (2) */ \"article table\" ) tables . forEach ( function ( table ) { new Tablesort ( table ) // (3) }) }) Annotations can contain arbitrary content which is shown when the marker is focussed, including any kind of formatting, links, admonitions, details, and even diagrams: graph LR A[I'm] --> B{a} --> C[diagram]; Tip: You can use Tab to navigate annotations. Annotations can be placed anywhere in a code block were a comment for the underlying language can be placed. Python # (1) JavaScript // (2) /* (2) */ Lua -- (3) We're working on a solution for languages without comments, which will be available shortly. Of course, this can be combined with line numbers , highlighting and all other code block related features. Annotations require syntax highlighting with Pygments \u2013 they're currently not compatible with other JavaScript-based syntax highlighters. Support may be added later on. Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the short name, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows splitting large code blocks for readability.

Configuration \u00b6 Definition List \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Definition List extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, adds the ability to add definitions lists to a document and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - def_list Tasklist \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Tasklist extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , adds support for lists with styled checkboxes, and provides several options for configuring the style: custom_checkbox Default: false \u00b7 This option toggles the rendering style of checkboxes, replacing native checkbox styles with beautiful icons, and is therefore strongly recommended : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.tasklist : custom_checkbox : true clickable_checkbox Default: false \u00b7 This option toggles whether checkboxes are clickable. As the state is not persisted, the use of this option is rather discouraged from a user experience perspective: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.tasklist : clickable_checkbox : true Usage \u00b6 Using unordered lists \u00b6 An unordered list can be written by prefixing a line with a - , * or + list marker, all of which can be used interchangeably. Furthermore, all flavors of lists can be nested inside each other. Example : - Nulla et rhoncus turpis. Mauris ultricies elementum leo. Duis efficitur accumsan nibh eu mattis. Vivamus tempus velit eros, porttitor placerat nibh lacinia sed. Aenean in finibus diam. * Duis mollis est eget nibh volutpat, fermentum aliquet dui mollis. * Nam vulputate tincidunt fringilla. * Nullam dignissim ultrices urna non auctor. Result : Nulla et rhoncus turpis. Mauris ultricies elementum leo. Duis efficitur accumsan nibh eu mattis. Vivamus tempus velit eros, porttitor placerat nibh lacinia sed. Aenean in finibus diam. Duis mollis est eget nibh volutpat, fermentum aliquet dui mollis. Nam vulputate tincidunt fringilla. Nullam dignissim ultrices urna non auctor. Using ordered lists \u00b6 An ordered list must start with a number immediately followed by a dot. The numbers do not need to be consecutive and can be all set to 1. , as they will be re-numbered when rendered. Example : 1. Vivamus id mi enim. Integer id turpis sapien. Ut condimentum lobortis sagittis. Aliquam purus tellus, faucibus eget urna at, iaculis venenatis nulla. Vivamus a pharetra leo. 1. Vivamus venenatis porttitor tortor sit amet rutrum. Pellentesque aliquet quam enim, eu volutpat urna rutrum a. Nam vehicula nunc mauris, a ultricies libero efficitur sed. 2. Morbi eget dapibus felis. Vivamus venenatis porttitor tortor sit amet rutrum. Pellentesque aliquet quam enim, eu volutpat urna rutrum a. 1. Mauris dictum mi lacus 2. Ut sit amet placerat ante 3. Suspendisse ac eros arcu Result : Vivamus id mi enim. Integer id turpis sapien. Ut condimentum lobortis sagittis. Aliquam purus tellus, faucibus eget urna at, iaculis venenatis nulla. Vivamus a pharetra leo. Vivamus venenatis porttitor tortor sit amet rutrum. Pellentesque aliquet quam enim, eu volutpat urna rutrum a. Nam vehicula nunc mauris, a ultricies libero efficitur sed. Morbi eget dapibus felis. Vivamus venenatis porttitor tortor sit amet rutrum. Pellentesque aliquet quam enim, eu volutpat urna rutrum a. Mauris dictum mi lacus Ut sit amet placerat ante Suspendisse ac eros arcu Using definition lists \u00b6 Definition lists are a ideal for describing arbitrary key-value pairs, e.g. the parameters of functions or modules, as used within this documentation to describe extension or plugin parameters.

While arbitrary metadata can always be added via customization , some common meta tags can be configured. Configuration \u00b6 Metadata \u00b6 The Metadata extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, adds the ability to add front matter to a document and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - meta Front matter is written as a series of key-value pairs at the beginning of the Markdown document, delimited by a blank line which ends the YAML context. Usage \u00b6 Setting the page title \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page title can be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet --- # Document title ... This will set the title tag inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Note that the site title is appended using a dash as a separator, which is the default behavior. Setting the page description \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page description can also be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. --- # Document title ... This will set the meta tag containing the site description inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Adding a web app manifest \u00b6 A web app manifest is a simple JSON file that specifies how your web application should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop, which can be set via mkdocs.yml : extra : manifest : manifest.webmanifest Customization \u00b6 Custom meta tags \u00b6 on all pages \u00b6 In order to add custom meta tags to your document, you can extend the theme and simply override the extrahead block , e.g. to add indexing policies for search engines: {% block extrahead %} < meta property = \"robots\" content = \"noindex, nofollow\" /> {% endblock %} on a single page \u00b6 If you want to set a meta tag on a single page, or want to set different values for different pages, you can use the page.meta object inside your template override, e.g.: {% block extrahead %} {% if page and page.meta and page.meta.robots %} < meta property = \"robots\" content = \"{{ page.meta.robots }}\" /> {% else %} < meta property = \"robots\" content = \"index, follow\" /> {% endif %} {% endblock %} You can now use robots exactly like title and description to set values.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.instant The resulting page is parsed and injected and all event handlers and components are rebound automatically. This means that Material for MkDocs behaves like a Single Page Application , which is especially useful for large documentation sites that come with a massive search index, as the search index will now remain intact in-between document switches.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.tracking Navigation tabs \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When tabs are enabled, top-level sections are rendered in a menu layer below the header for viewports above 1220px , but remain as-is on mobile. 1 Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.tabs With tabs Without tabs Sticky navigation tabs \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only When sticky tabs are enabled, navigation tabs will lock below the header and always remain visible when scrolling down. Just add the following two feature flags to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.tabs - navigation.tabs.sticky With sticky tabs Without sticky tabs Navigation sections \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When sections are enabled, top-level sections are rendered as groups in the sidebar for viewports above 1220px , but remain as-is on mobile. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.sections With sections Without sections Both feature flags, tabs and sections , can be combined with each other. If both feature flags are enabled, sections are rendered for level 2 navigation items. Navigation expansion \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When expansion is enabled, the left sidebar will expand all collapsible subsections by default, so the user doesn't have to open subsections manually. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.expand With expansion Without expansion Section index pages \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only When section index pages are enabled, documents can be directly attached to sections, which is particularly useful for providing overview pages. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.indexes With section index pages Without section index pages In order to link a page to a section, create a new document with the name index.md in the respective folder, and add it to the beginning of your navigation section: nav : - Section : - section/index.md - Page 1 : section/page-1.md ... - Page n : section/page-n.md This feature flag can be combined with all other feature flags, e.g. tabs and sections , except for table of contents navigation integration . Note that it doesn't rely on third-party plugins 2 . Back-to-top button \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag A back-to-top button can be shown when the user, after scrolling down, starts to scroll up again. It's rendered in the lower right corner of the viewport. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.top Table of contents \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Table of contents extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, provides some options that are supported by Material for MkDocs to customize its appearance: permalink Default: false \u2013 This option adds an anchor link containing the paragraph symbol \u00b6 or another custom symbol at the end of each headline, exactly like on the page you're currently viewing, which Material for MkDocs will make appear on hover: \u00b6 markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : true \u2693\ufe0e markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : \u2693\ufe0e slugify Default: headerid.slugify \u2013 This option allows for customization of the slug function.

Use them at your own risk. Navigation integration \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When integration is enabled, the table of contents is rendered as part of the navigation for viewports above 1220px , but remains as-is on mobile. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - toc.integrate Integrate table of contents Separate table of contents The content section will now always stretch to the right side, resulting in more space for your content. This feature flag can be combined with all other feature flags, e.g. tabs and sections . Usage \u00b6 Hiding the sidebars \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Metadata Sometimes it's desirable to hide the navigation and/or table of contents sidebar, especially when there's a single navigation item. This can be done for any page using the Metadata extension: --- hide: - navigation - toc --- # Document title ... Hide navigation Hide table of contents Hide both Customization \u00b6 Keyboard shortcuts \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs includes several keyboard shortcuts that make it possible to navigate your project documentation via keyboard. There're two modes: search This mode is active when the search is focused . It provides several key bindings to make search accessible and navigable via keyboard: Down , Up : select next / previous result Esc , Tab : close search dialog Enter : follow selected result global This mode is active when search is not focussed and when there's no other focussed element that is susceptible to keyboard input. The following keys are bound: F , S , / : open search dialog P , , : go to previous page N , . : go to next page Let's say you want to bind some action to the X key. By using additional JavaScript , you can subscribe to the keyboard$ observable and attach your custom event listener: keyboard$ . subscribe ( function ( key ) { if ( key . mode === \"global\" && key . type === \"x\" ) { /* Add custom keyboard handler here */ key . claim () } }) The call to key . claim () will essentially execute preventDefault () on the underlying event, so the keypress will not propagate further and touch other event listeners. Content area width \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy The width of the content area is set so the length of each line doesn't exceed 80-100 characters, depending on the width of the characters. While this is a reasonable default, as longer lines tend to be harder to read, it may be desirable to increase the overall width of the content area, or even make it stretch to the entire available space. This can easily be achieved with an additional stylesheet and a few lines of CSS: Increase width . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; } Stretch to fit . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } Prior to version 6.2, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior. All top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries that directly refer to an *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml were grouped under the first tab which received the title of the first page. This made it impossible to include a top-level page (or external link) as a tab item, as was reported in #1884 and #2072 . From version 6.2 on, navigation tabs include all top-level pages and sections. \u21a9 If you don't want to use the native integration, the mkdocs-section-index plugin might be an alternative.

Usage \u00b6 Boosting a page \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Metadata \u00b7 Insiders only In order to give specific pages a higher relevance in search, lunr supports page-specific boosts, which can be defined for each page by leveraging the Metadata extension: --- search: boost: 100 --- # Document title ... Customization \u00b6 The search implementation of Material for MkDocs is probably its most sophisticated feature, as it tries to balance a great typeahead experience , good performance , accessibility , and a result list that is easy to scan . This is where Material for MkDocs deviates from other themes. The following section explains how search can be customized to tailor it to your needs. Query transformation \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy When a user enters a query into the search box, the query is pre-processed before it is submitted to the search index. Material for MkDocs will apply the following transformations, which can be customized by extending the theme : export function defaultTransform ( query : string ) : string { return query . split ( /\"([^\"]+)\"/g ) /* (1) */ . map (( terms , index ) => index & 1 ? terms . replace ( /^\\b|^(?![^\\x00-\\x7F]|$)|\\s+/g , \" +\" ) : terms ) . join ( \"\" ) . replace ( /\"|(?:^|\\s+)[*+\\-:^~]+(?=\\s+|$)/g , \"\" ) /* (2) */ . trim () /* (3) */ } Search for terms in quotation marks and prepend a + modifier to denote that the resulting document must contain all terms, converting the query to an AND query (as opposed to the default OR behavior). While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index. Custom search \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: challenging Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker . If you want to switch the web worker with your own implementation, e.g. to submit search to an external service, you can add a custom JavaScript file to the docs directory and override the config block : {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { worker : \"<url>\" } </ script > {% endblock %} Communication with the search worker is implemented using a designated message format using discriminated unions , i.e. through the type property of the message.

This means you never have to worry about breaking changes in MkDocs, since your old docs (built with an old version of MkDocs) are already generated and sitting in your gh-pages branch. While mike is flexible, it's optimized around putting your docs in a <major>.<minor> directory, with optional aliases (e.g. latest or dev ) to particularly notable versions. This makes it easy to make permalinks to whatever version of the documentation you want to direct people to.

Version warning \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Insiders only If you're using versioning, you might want to display a warning when the user visits any other version than the latest version. Using theme extension , you can define the outdated block : {% block outdated %} You're not viewing the latest version. < a href = \"{{ '../' ~ base_url }}\" > <!-- (1) --> < strong > Click here to go to latest. </ strong > </ a > {% endblock %} Given this value for the href attribute, the link will always redirect to the root of your site, which will then redirect to the latest version. This ensures that older versions of your site do not depend on a specific alias, e.g. latest , to allow for changing the alias later on without breaking earlier versions. This will render a version warning above the header: By default, the default version is identified by the latest alias. If you wish to set another alias as the latest version, e.g. stable , add the following to mkdocs.yml : extra : version : default : stable Make sure that this matches the default version .
